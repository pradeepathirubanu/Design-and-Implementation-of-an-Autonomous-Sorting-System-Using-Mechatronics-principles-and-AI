Design and Implementation of an Autonomous Sorting System Using Mechatronics principles and AI

Project Overview
This project implements an intelligent, autonomous sorting system that uses mechatronics components and artificial
intelligence (AI) to identify and sort objects based on physical attributes such as shape, size, and color. 
It automates the sorting process with high accuracy and adaptability for industrial and smart automation applications.
